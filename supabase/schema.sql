-- Admin console storage. Run once against a fresh Supabase project:
--   Supabase dashboard -> SQL Editor -> paste -> Run.
-- Re-running is safe; every statement is idempotent.
--
-- WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL. CLAUDE.md says the site has no database, and that was
-- right while every surface was a static page and every lead was an email. The
-- admin console needs two things a static site cannot have: a lead history that
-- outlives an inbox, and traffic the site itself can read back. So the exception
-- is widened deliberately and narrowly:
--
--   * Visitor-facing pages still read NOTHING from here. If Supabase is down or
--     unconfigured, /, /caio, /assessment and /api/ask behave exactly as before.
--     Writes are fire-and-forget; a failed write loses a row, never a lead.
--   * Web3Forms remains the delivery path for every lead. This table is the
--     RECORD, not the notification. If the two ever disagree, the inbox wins.
--   * Nothing here feeds the Q&A agent's grounding. Facts still come only from
--     facts.ts.
--
-- ACCESS MODEL. RLS is on for every table with no policies attached, so the
-- anon key can read and write nothing. Only the service-role key reaches this
-- data, it lives in Vercel env vars, and it is never shipped to a browser.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Events — first-party traffic
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Deliberately not a general analytics store. It answers the questions this
-- practice actually has: which surface is the front door, does the assessment
-- page feed /caio, do people open the agent, do they start the form and stop.
--
-- `visitor` is a DAILY-ROTATING hash of IP + user-agent + a server salt. It
-- makes "how many people" answerable without storing an identifier that follows
-- someone across days. Raw IPs are never written.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The first table here that is about a PERSON rather than an event, and the
-- only one whose rows a non-admin can cause to be read. It gates /craft, the
-- cohort's course area.
--
-- WHY A CODE AND NOT A PASSWORD. Eight seats. A password means a set-password
-- flow, a reset flow, and an email sender to keep alive for eight people who
-- each log in a handful of times over six weeks. Instead Sunil issues a
-- 24-byte random code from /admin/learners when someone accepts a seat, and
-- sends it however he is already talking to them. The code IS the credential:
-- high entropy, no user-chosen weakness, revocable in one click.
--
-- Only the HMAC of the code is stored. A read of this table — a leaked service
-- key, a Supabase console left open — does not yield anything that can sign in,
-- because the HMAC secret lives in Vercel's env, not in the database.
--
-- `status` is the whole authorization model: 'active' signs in, anything else
-- ('revoked', 'withdrawn') does not. Rows are kept rather than deleted so a
-- withdrawn participant leaves a record.

-- Radar — market intelligence, for Sunil only
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Was src/data/radar.json, refreshed by a weekly agent that opened a pull
-- request. The review gate made sense for the visitor-facing retriever, whose
-- output a chatbot repeats verbatim to prospects. It made much less sense here:
-- nothing on the public site reads the radar, so the PR was gating a private
-- notebook — and it cost a merge and a deploy before Sunil could read what his
-- own agent had found.
--
-- Moving it here changes what "review" means rather than removing it. Findings
-- land with status = 'new'; hiding one is an UPDATE instead of a pull request,
-- and reading one no longer requires shipping a deployment.
--
-- The visitor Q&A agent still cannot reach this. That was previously enforced
-- by src/pages/api/ask.ts not importing a module; it is now enforced by ask.ts
-- not querying a table. Keep it that way — investment figures, India hiring
-- numbers and claims about what is failing are Sunil's to judge before
-- repeating, not a chatbot's to volunteer.
